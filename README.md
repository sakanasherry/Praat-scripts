# Praat-scripts
Just some praat scripts I use.

Note: 

Files starting with "Vowel" are designed to extract measurements from specific intervals.
* If you want to extract measurements from intervals that only contain certain words/letters, you can refer to my scripts.
* In my examples, I wanted to extract data from intervals in labels containing "i, u, y". You might want to edit that part ("if index... <> 0 or ...") in the script when applying it to your own script.
