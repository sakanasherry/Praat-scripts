# Praat-scripts
Just some praat scripts I use.

Note:

Files starting with "Vowel" are designed to extract measurements from specific intervals.
In other words, when you only want to extract measurements from intervals that contain certain words/letters, you can refer to my scripts. In my examples, I want to extract data from intervals in the labels that contain "i, u, y". So, you should edit this part when applying it to your own script.
